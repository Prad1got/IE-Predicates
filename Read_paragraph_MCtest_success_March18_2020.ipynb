              "'One sunny morning, Stewart chose to go to the beach. He knew that a rainstorm was going to arrive on Saturday and wanted to enjoy some sun before it arrived. Stewart laid on his belly and began reading his newspaper. As he was enjoying the sun and the newspaper, he saw a bug crawl across his blanket. At first Stewart thought it was an ant, but the bug was moving too slowly to be an ant. As Stewart leaned in for a closer look, the bug cried out, \"Excuse me, sir! Can you help me?\" Stewart was surprised and jumped to his feet. \"You can talk!\" he shouted. \"Yes,\" said the bug. \"Please help me! As you might know, there is a rainstorm coming into town. Unfortunately, I do not have a place to call home. I need to find somewhere to sleep before the rain washes me away!\" Stewart felt sad. \"Gee,\" he cried. \"That sounds terrible!\"Stewart thought about the problem. \"Perhaps you can stay at my house,\" he said. The bug jumped for joy and said, \"Oh, that would be wonderful!\" The two traveled back to Stewart\\'s house and the bug found a soft spot to sleep.The next day, the sky had darkened and rain clouds appeared all over town. Just as the news had said, a rainstorm had arrived. When Stewart woke up, he looked for the bug but could not find him. Then, he saw something flying around his house. \"Thank you for letting me sleep here last night,\" said the butterfly. It was the bug! \"I knew I could not change into a butterfly if I was out in the rain. I will not forget your kindness.\" After speaking, the butterfly flew away. Stewart stood in his doorway and shouted, \"Goodbye!\"'"

I watch every movie I can, and try to learn all of the different costumes by heart. Mommy says if I work hard and keep up my practice, one day I will get to to make costumes for movie stars too! That job sounds like heaven.One day I was in the attic, helping Mommy make a boot for a costume.  They were covered in little beads, and mom had to sew them on. She kept dropping the needles on the ground. Then I was helping by picking them up. I was also helping by moving the lamp around so Mommy could see the boot better. \"Ouch!\" I said. \"I accidentally stuck my finger with the needle!\"My mommy looked at my finger, and gave it a kiss.  \"Welcome to the life of a costumer!\"'"

The night she met her noodle friend was spaghetti night.  Marsha's favorite dinner was spaghetti, which happened to be every Tuesday night.  On one Tuesday, a piece of spaghetti fell on the kitchen floor.  To Marsha, it looked like a stick man so she kept him.  She named her new noodle friend Joey and took him everywhere she went.  Sometimes Joey gets a little dried out so Marsha's mom told her to soak him in water every few days.  There were a couple times that the family dog, Mika, has tried to take Joey from Marsha and eat him!  So from now on, Marsha takes extra special care to make sure Joey is safe and sound at all times.  During the day she keeps him in a plastic bag in her pocket.  At night, she puts him under her pillow.  She loves Joey and wants to always be friends with him.\""

After she is done, she gives the picture to her mom. Her mom hangs it up on the silver refrigerator. The next day, Lucy\\'s mom comes home with a brown dog named Oliver. She tells Lucy that she is pet-sitting, which is like babysitting but with a friend\\'s dog. Lucy\\'s mom tells her she can play with the dog as long as she takes good care of him. Lucy is excited. She pets Oliver nicely on his soft back. He wags his tail. He barks, \"Woof!\" and shows he wants to play fetch with her. Lucy giggles and throws a ball for him to catch. She wishes her bird could play like this with her every day!'"
